Welcome to my personal homepage. It's supposed to be mainly a research related page, but since I feel inadequately described by only my academic endeavors, you will also find posts on other things I'm passionate about, such as cycling, or music.

[//]: # ([cycling]&#40;/al-folio/cycling/&#41;, or [music]&#40;/al-folio/music/&#41;.)

I hold a Ph.D. from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technolgy (KIT) in Computer Science and an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (ETiT) from the Technical University of Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt).
During my Ph.D., I focussed on reinforcement learning and my [thesis](/assets/pdf/diss_mh.pdf) is concerned with state representation in homogeneous swarms, as well as exploration of high dimensional action spaces in episode-based reinforcement learning.

I also worked as an AI Researcher at [appliedAI](https://www.appliedai.de/), a German AI engineering, strategy, and research start-up where I contributed to [tianshou](https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou), gave a [seminar talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2Ea69qFeL4) on episode-based reinforcement learning with movement primitives, and taught the basics of machine learning in an Introduction to AI course to industry partners.
